# Learning Goals

 - Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in views and controllers
 - Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to join multiple tables of data, make calculations, and group data based on one or more attributes
 - Write model tests that fully cover the data logic of the application
 - Write feature tests that fully cover the functionality of the application
